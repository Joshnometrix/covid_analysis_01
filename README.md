# covid_analysis_01
This project is focused on analysing data using SQL on covid-19 infected, death cases and vaccinations all over the world up till 17th of January 2022.
Our table was divided into two tables: covid_death, which we use to analyse the infected and death cases and covid_vaccinations, which was used to analyse the number of people vaccinated at least once and those fully vaccinated all over the world.
